Solana is a public blockchain that achieves consensus using a unique proof of history algorithm. It promises a very high transactions per second rate, without requiring a level 2 chain or sharding.

On-chain programs are usually written in Rust and compiled using LLVM to a variation of the Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) bytecode.
