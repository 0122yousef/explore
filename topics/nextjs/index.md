Next.js is a React framework with a focus on production and efficiency created and maintained by the Vercel team, Next seeks to bring together several features such as hybrid and static content rendering, TypeScript support, pre-fetching, route system, feature packs and several plugins and examples to accelerate your development providing a complete structure for you to start your project.

With all these pre-configured facilities it is assimilated to a create react app where you start the project very fast and without worrying about webpack settings, folder structures, route configuration and so on.
